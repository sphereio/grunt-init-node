sphere-grunt-init 
=================

This is a project template used for creating sphere node modules using [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) (scaffolding tool used to automate project creation).

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install `grunt-init`
```bash
npm install -g grunt-init
```

Once `grunt-init` is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:sphereio/sphere-grunt-init.git ~/.grunt-init/sphere-node
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init sphere-node

# or use the path to the template
grunt-init ~/dev/src/sphere-grunt-init
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
